# Decentralized Raffle Smart Contract

A provably fair lottery system built on Ethereum using Chainlink VRF for verifiable random number generation and automated winner selection.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized raffle (lottery) system where participants can enter by paying an entrance fee, and a winner is automatically selected using Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF). The contract ensures fairness through cryptographic randomness and transparency through blockchain technology.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ² Provably Fair Randomness
- Utilizes **Chainlink VRF v2** for cryptographically secure random number generation
- Eliminates any possibility of manipulation in winner selection
- Provides verifiable proof of randomness on-chain

### âš¡ Automated Operations
- **Chainlink Automation** (Keepers) integration for automatic raffle execution
- Time-based triggers ensure raffles conclude at predetermined intervals
- No manual intervention required for winner selection

### ðŸ”’ Secure State Management
- Two-state system: `OPEN` (accepting entries) and `CALCULATING` (selecting winner)
- Prevents entries during winner calculation period
- Ensures atomic operations for prize distribution

### ðŸ’° Transparent Prize Pool
- All entrance fees accumulate in the contract
- Winner receives the entire prize pool
- Failed transfers are handled with proper error reporting

### Smart Contract Components

**Core Functionality:**
- `enterRaffle()`: Allows participants to enter by paying the entrance fee
- `checkUpkeep()`: Validates if conditions are met for winner selection
- `performUpkeep()`: Initiates the random number request process
- `fulfillRandomWords()`: Callback function that selects and pays the winner

**State Variables:**
- `i_entranceFee`: Minimum payment required to enter
- `i_interval`: Time duration between raffle rounds
- `s_players`: Dynamic array storing participant addresses
- `s_raffleState`: Current state of the raffle (OPEN/CALCULATING)

### Chainlink Integration

**VRF (Verifiable Random Function):**
- Provides cryptographically secure randomness
- Requires subscription to Chainlink VRF service
- Configurable gas limits and confirmation requirements

**Automation (Keepers):**
- Monitors contract state for automation triggers
- Executes `performUpkeep()` when conditions are met
- Ensures timely raffle execution without manual intervention

## Prerequisites

- **Chainlink VRF Subscription**: Required for random number generation
- **Chainlink Automation Registration**: Needed for automated raffle execution
- **LINK Tokens**: For funding VRF requests and automation

## Configuration Parameters

When deploying, you'll need to configure:

- `vrfCoordinatorV2`: Address of Chainlink VRF Coordinator
- `entranceFee`: Minimum entry fee in wei
- `interval`: Duration between raffles in seconds
- `keyHash`: Gas lane key hash for VRF requests
- `subscriptionId`: Your Chainlink VRF subscription ID
- `callbackGasLimit`: Gas limit for VRF callback function

## Contract Events

- `RaffleEntered(address indexed player)`: Emitted when someone enters the raffle
- `WinnerPicked(address indexed winner)`: Emitted when a winner is selected

## Security Features

- **Reentrancy Protection**: State changes before external calls
- **Access Control**: Only VRF Coordinator can fulfill random words
- **Error Handling**: Custom errors for different failure scenarios
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient storage patterns and immutable variables

## Development Stack

- **Solidity ^0.8.19**: Smart contract language
- **Foundry**: Development framework for testing and deployment
- **Chainlink VRF v2**: Verifiable random number generation
- **Chainlink Automation**: Automated smart contract execution

## How It Works

1. **Entry Phase**: Users call `enterRaffle()` with the required entrance fee
2. **Monitoring**: Chainlink Automation continuously monitors the contract
3. **Trigger**: When time interval passes and conditions are met, `performUpkeep()` is called
4. **Random Request**: Contract requests a random number from Chainlink VRF
5. **Winner Selection**: VRF callback selects a winner and transfers the prize
6. **Reset**: Contract resets for the next raffle round

This implementation ensures a completely trustless, transparent, and fair lottery system powered by Chainlink's decentralized oracle infrastructure.
